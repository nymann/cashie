## How to contribute to FastAPI Template

#### Support questions
We prefer if you don't use the issue tracker for support questions.

The `#support-questions` channel in our
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/FWNRMcF) is the preferred place to seek
help.

#### Submitting patches
If there is not an open issue for what you want to submit, prefer opening one 
for discussion before working on a PR. You can work on any issue that doesn't 
have an open PR linked to it or a maintainer assigned to it. These show up in
the sidebar. No need to ask if you can work on an issue that interests you.

We are using
[Googles styleguide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md)
in this project.

##### First time setup
For local development you have two options:

**Docker**
`docker-compose up -d`

**Python**
`python setup.py develop`

If you have [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed you'll
find short hands for most things by opening the `Makefile`.
